\subsection{Scrum of scrums}
Scrum of Scrums is a framework for scaling scrum across an organization. It allows each scrum team freedom to operate while providing a structure for communicating progress. 

In the ECDAR project the term scrum of scrums was introduced to cooperate transparency between the groups.
In scrum of scrums we do not have daily scrums because the daily scrums is hold in the smaller groups.
The key events in scrum of scrums are the sprint planning sprint review and sprint retrospective.
Look at \autoref{fig:scrum-of-scrums-events} for a more detailed look of the different events between scrum and scrum of scrums.


Because there were so many students working on the ECDAR project the scrum meetings would get too big if every group member attended the meetings.
Based on that the groups choose a committee to attend the scrum meetings.

The multi project is separated in two parts. 
There are five project groups working on the Reveaal part and one group working on the GUI part.
Because of this we have two product owners.
One product owner for the Reveaal part and one for the GUI part.
