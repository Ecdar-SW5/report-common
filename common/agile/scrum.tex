\subsection{Scrum}\label{sub:scrum}
Scrum is an agile framework that developers use to ensure a development process where "Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, and Courage" is valued and practiced \cite{schwaber_sutherland_2022}. Scrum is not an acronym. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, it is a rugby term that describes a situation where "... the forwards from each team pack together, heads down and arms interlocked, and push against the opposing forwards in order to gain possession of the ball ..." \cite{oedscrum}.


% Roles
\subsubsection{Roles}
The scrum framework describes a team that includes a \emph{Scrum Master}, a \emph{Product Owner} and \emph{Developers}. These roles, described below, are all equally vital. Scrum does not define a hierarchy. Instead, everyone on the team is responsible for playing their part in the development and ensuring that working software is delivered. Scrum is based on having a small and nimble team that is still large enough to make significant progress each sprint. These teams should typically be less than 10 people \cite{schwaber_sutherland_2022}.

\paragraph{The Product Owner}
is responsible for maximizing the value created by the scrum teams. It is also the product owners responsibility to manage the \emph{product backlog} and communicating what the product goal is \cite{schwaber_sutherland_2022}. The product backlog is an ordered list of the work that needs to be done \cite{schwaber_sutherland_2022}.

\paragraph{The Scrum Master}
is responsible for making sure the team is focused on reaching the goal and maintaining an environment where the scrum values are upheld. The scrum master is not a manager but a developer on equal terms with the rest of the team \cite{schwaber_sutherland_2022}.

\paragraph{The Developers}
make up rest of the team members are all developers and are accountable for creating usable \emph{Increments} during the \emph{Sprint}. An increment is a tangible step towards the product goal which meets the definition of done. 
Developers take part in creating the sprint backlog, ensuring that increments adhere to the definition of done and adapting their daily plan in accordance with the current sprint goal \cite{schwaber_sutherland_2022}.

% Events
\subsubsection{Scrum Events}
The Scrum framework contains 5 events. These events are designed to enable transparency and create opportunities for course correction  \cite{schwaber_sutherland_2022}.

\paragraph{The Sprint}
is a fixed length event, typically a month or less. This event is where value is created. During the sprint, items from the sprint backlog are turned into increments by the developers \cite{schwaber_sutherland_2022}.

\paragraph{Sprint Planning}
is where the scrum team creates a plan for the sprint. The plan should specify three things. Firstly, the plan should address why the sprint is valuable to the development of the product. Secondly, it should address which items from the product backlog will be added to the \emph{Sprint Backlog}. The sprint backlog is the set of product backlog items the scrum team has selected for the sprint. Finally, the team should discuss \emph{how} they will approach each backlog item and ensure that it will meet the \emph{definition of done}.


\paragraph{Daily Scrum}
is a short meeting that's completed each day where the progress is inspected.
This event improves the group members communication skills, helps identify impediments and creates an opportunity for the team to share knowledge.
The daily scrum is also used for adapt or re-planning the work of the ongoing sprint \cite{schwaber_sutherland_2022}.

\paragraph{Sprint Review}
is the second last event before a new sprint begins.
Its purpose is to inspect the outcome of the sprint adjust the product backlog accordingly \cite{schwaber_sutherland_2022}.

\paragraph{Sprint Retrospective}
is the last event in the sprint before a new sprint begins. In a sprint retrospective, the team discusses how the processes and interactions during the sprint helped or hindered the development process. Then the team will discuss how it can improve its effectiveness and the quality of the outcome in the sprint to come \cite{schwaber_sutherland_2022}.
