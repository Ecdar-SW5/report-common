\subsection{External Pull Requests Review}\label{sec:externalPRreview}
Whenever code had to be merged to the SW5 fork, it had to be reviewed and accepted by at least two members of other groups.
The groups are split about how well this went, half think it went well, while the other half did not.
Most groups agree that the idea was good, but all groups agree that the execution was not ideal.

The problems that are mentioned by almost every group, are that the process typically took a while and it was often the same people doing the reviews.
This meant that it was often the same few groups that did all the PRs, and when they then had to have a PR approved it was slow, since they were the ones typically reviewing all the PRs.

Another problem was that there was a group dedicated to the GUI that didn't know rust, so they couldn't review the other group's code and when they made a PR then it was not in rust so the other groups were often slow to review it.
Some suggestions were made by the groups to fix these problems, these suggestions included appointing a review responsible person from each group at each SoS meeting, making a dedicated time slot where everyone reviewed PRs, and assigning certain PRs to relevant groups, if there were any.
