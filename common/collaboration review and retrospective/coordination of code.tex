\subsection{Coordination of Code}\label{sec:coordinationofcode}
Coordination of code is about coordinating who writes what, where and at what times.
It assures that no two groups were waiting on each other or working on the same, thus creating merge conflicts, was not done properly. Multiple times throughout the project one group was dependent on code from another group in order to progress and was thus stuck. 
One example of this was between the reachability group and the simulation group, where the reachability group had nothing to do at all because they were waiting for the simulation group to add something that the simulation group had only assigned one person to.
The reachability group took over this task the following sprint, since it was not completed.
One way to fix this, is by making it clear doing the SoS meetings who has code that depend on each other.
Then the tasks can be divided between the groups depending on each other, or outright assigning it to one of them, if they have nothing else they can do, while the other group has something to work on.
