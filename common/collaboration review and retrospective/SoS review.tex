\subsection{Scrum of Scrums review}\label{sec:sosreview}
Scrum of Scrums was overall well received, however some negative aspects were also present.
Most groups agree that it was good and well structured, since it gave an overview of what the other groups were doing and what their blockers were.
This could then be used to see how their own code could potentially be blocked, by what another group was doing.
At the SoS meetings everyone was informed about what was done, what is being done, and what is going to be done this sprint. 
How long the sprints had to be was decided at the first SoS meeting.
It was decided that all group's sprints should be two weeks long. This was not agile since it was extremely rigid, and not allowing for longer tasks or shorter ones, even if it was needed.
It is however understandable that a common sprint length was decided, otherwise there would have to be many more Scrum of Scrums meetings, and there would potentially be less to talk about and some groups would be in the middle of tasks and so on.
Overall the structure of the Scrum of Scrums meetings was great, however what was discussed in the retro part of the meetings, was not really acted upon as much as it should've.
