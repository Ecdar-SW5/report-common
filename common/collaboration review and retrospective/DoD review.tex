\subsection{Definition of Done Review}\label{sec:DoDreview}
A DoD was made, but it varied between each group how much it was used and followed.
One group used and considered it a great deal, two did a moderate amount, one a little, and lastly, two did not use it at all.

For certain groups it felt irrelevant, while other groups felt it was a good idea.
Some groups thought that certain parts of the DoD, such as benchmarking all features, was a bit too much to do every time a feature was made, no matter how big or small it was.
Multiple groups also thought that it did not contribute much, since it was not strict enough, because not using it had no consequences, and at that point it felt unnecessary to even have a DoD.
So the DoD was not used that much, to fix this, if a DoD is wanted, it could be possible to say that code cannot be merged if it did not fulfill the DoD, this means every group was forced to follow it and consider it while coding.
