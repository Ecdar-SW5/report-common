\subsection{Purpose}
ECDAR was based on the tedious process of model checking the correctness of a real-timed system, if it were to be done by hand, by using for example: Unit-testing.
Not only is it tedious when done by hand, it is also error-prone.

By providing a tool that can both be reliable and productive at testing if a new system is true to its corresponding model, we can not only ensure that time will be saved, but also the correctness of the system.
ECDAR therefore tests the correctness of the model using timed I/O automata.
%% It parallelizes test-case generation and test execution to provide this significant speed-up.

To sum up, what the purpose of ECDAR is:
"...Ecdar that integrates conformance testing into a new IDE that now features
modelling, verification, and testing. The new tool uses model-based mutation testing, requiring only
the model and the system under test, to locate faults and to prove the absence of certain types of
faults." \cite{Gundersen_2018}
