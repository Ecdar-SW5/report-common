A real-time system is a system that responds to input in real time, and where the timing of when the output is delivered is\cite{realtime2006}.
If the output of a real-time system is delayed due to processing time, the output is no longer valid.
An example of a real-time system is self-driving cars, which have to make navigational decisions and be able to adapt quickly to accommodate other drivers.
