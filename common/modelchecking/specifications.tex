% What is a specification in theory.
In the context of systems design, a specification is the collection of interfaces that the components in the system should implement \cite{ecdartheory}. 
Interfaces dictate how components can interact, and systems are designed by creating the interfaces that the components in the actual system will implement.

% What is a specification in ecdar?
In ECDAR, a specification is represented as a timed input/output transition system, because they support the various operations used in model checking \cite{ecdartheory}.
