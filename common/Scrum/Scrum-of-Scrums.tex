\section{Scrum of scrums}
In the ECDAR project the term scrum of scrums was introduced to cooperate transparency between the groups.
In scrum of scrums we do not have daily scrums because the daily scrums is hold in the smaller groups.
The key events in scrum of scrums are the sprint planning sprint review and sprint retrospective.

Because there were is so many students working on the ECDAR project the scrum meetings would get too big if every group member attended the meetings.
Based on that the groups choose a committee to attend the scrum meetings.

The multi project is separated in two parts. 
There are five project groups working on the Reveaal part and one group working on the GUI part.
Because of this we have two product owners.
One product owner for the Reveaal part and different one for the GUI part.
