\subsection{Scrum}
Scrum is a framework developers use to ensure a development process where "Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, and Courage" is valued and practiced \cite{schwaber_sutherland_2022}. According to the scrum framework, a \emph{Scrum Master} is responsible for making sure the team is focused on reaching the goal and maintaining an environment where the scrum values are upheld. A \emph{Product Owner} is responsible for creating and maintaining a \emph{Product Backlog}, an ordered list of the work that needs to be completed.
