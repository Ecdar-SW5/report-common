\section{Multi-project Cooperation}\label{Scrum/multi-project-cooperation}
The ECDAR project is a newly started project and because of that there have not been any iteration of the project.
Because of this the groups first job was to startup everything cooperation related. 
The way the groups uphold knowledge sharing were by having scrum meetings.

There were six project groups that choose ECDAR as their semester project. 
Five groups that choose to work with the reveaal engine and one group that choose the graphical user interface engine.
Because there were so many students working on the ECDAR project the scrum meetings would get too big if every group member attended the meetings.
Based on that the groups choose a committee to attend the scrum meetings.

To communicate between groups a discord server was created.
