\section{Multi-project Cooperation}\label{Scrum/multi-project-cooperation}
\textit{The following sections is written in collaboration with other ECDAR project groups.}

The ECDAR project is a newly started project and therefore there have not been any iteration of the project.
For the first iteration the groups first job was to startup everything collaboration related. 
The way the groups could uphold knowledge sharing was by planing scrum meetings.

There were six project groups that choose ECDAR as their semester project. 
Five groups that choose to work with the reveaal engine and one group that choose the graphical user interface engine.
%Because there were so many students working on the ECDAR project the scrum meetings would get too big if every group member attended the meetings.
%Based on that the groups choose a committee to attend the scrum meetings.
